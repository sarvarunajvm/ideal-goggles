## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story

A photo studio operator needs to find specific photos from their extensive archive. They want to combine multiple search methods in a single query:
- Text description: "sunset beach"
- Reference image: Upload similar photo as visual example
- Filters: Date range (June-August 2024), location (California), camera (Canon EOS R5)
- Exclusions: "NOT people" to exclude photos with people
- Color preference: Warm orange tones
- Sort by: Most recent first

The system processes all criteria together, returning highly relevant results that match text semantics, visual similarity, metadata filters, and color preferences, while excluding unwanted elements.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** user enters text "sunset beach" AND uploads reference image AND adds date filter "2024-06-01 to 2024-08-31", **When** search executes, **Then** results match all three criteria ranked by combined relevance score

2. **Given** user searches "landscape NOT people", **When** search processes query, **Then** system returns landscape photos while excluding any photos containing detected persons

3. **Given** user clicks on a photo's dominant orange color swatch, **When** color search activates, **Then** system finds photos with similar warm color palettes

4. **Given** user creates complex search with 5+ filters, **When** they click "Save Search", **Then** search is saved with custom name and appears in saved searches list for quick re-execution

5. **Given** user types "suns" in search box, **When** autocomplete activates, **Then** system suggests "sunset", "sunrise", "sunshine", "sunflower" based on existing tags and search history

6. **Given** user searches for "Canon EOS R5 ISO > 3200", **When** metadata search processes, **Then** only photos taken with that camera at high ISO settings appear

7. **Given** large result set (10,000+ photos), **When** user refines search within results, **Then** system filters existing results without re-searching entire library

### Edge Cases

- What happens when combining conflicting criteria (e.g., text says "sunset" but reference image shows "sunrise")?
- How does system handle searches with no results matching all criteria?
- What if user saves 100+ searches - how are they organized?
- How are search suggestions generated when library has limited variety?
- What happens when reference image upload fails or is unsupported format?
- How does negative search handle edge cases (e.g., "NOT beach" when some photos are ambiguous)?
