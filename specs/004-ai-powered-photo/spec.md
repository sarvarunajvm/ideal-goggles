## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story

A photographer reviews event photos and finds several that need improvement: some are too dark, others have noise from high ISO, and a few low-resolution images need upscaling for print. Instead of opening external editors, they use Ideal Goggles' built-in AI enhancement:
- One-click auto-enhance improves exposure, contrast, and color balance
- AI upscaling doubles resolution of low-res photos for 16x20 prints
- Denoise removes graininess from high-ISO nighttime shots
- Background removal isolates subjects for composite work
- All edits remain non-destructive, storing only adjustment parameters

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** underexposed photo selected, **When** user clicks "Auto-Enhance", **Then** system analyzes and applies optimal brightness, contrast, and saturation adjustments within 2 seconds

2. **Given** 1080p photo needs printing at 300 DPI, **When** user selects "AI Upscale 2x", **Then** system generates 4K version with enhanced details using deep learning super-resolution

3. **Given** nighttime photo with ISO 6400 noise, **When** user applies "AI Denoise", **Then** system reduces noise while preserving fine details and sharpness

4. **Given** portrait photo selected, **When** user clicks "Remove Background", **Then** system accurately segments subject from background creating transparent PNG

5. **Given** enhanced photo, **When** user clicks "Reset", **Then** all AI edits are discarded and original photo is restored instantly

6. **Given** batch of 50 photos selected, **When** user applies "Batch Auto-Enhance", **Then** system processes all photos with consistent enhancements showing progress indicator

### Edge Cases

- What happens when AI enhancement makes photo worse (subjectively)?
- How does system handle photos already at maximum resolution during upscaling?
- What if background removal fails on complex/ambiguous scenes?
- How are enhancement parameters stored without modifying original files?
- What happens when processing very large RAW files (50MB+)?
- How does batch processing handle failures on individual photos?
