   �  All requirements testable and measurable
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   �  Photos, search indexes, thumbnails, metadata identified
7. Run Review Checklist
   �  No implementation details, focused on user needs
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a photo studio operator, I need to quickly find specific client photos from our archive of hundreds of thousands of images so that I can fulfill client requests within minutes instead of hours of manual searching through folders.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a studio has 500,000 photos indexed, **When** operator searches for "wedding Smith 2023", **Then** relevant photos appear within 2 seconds with thumbnails and folder paths
2. **Given** a client brings a printed photo, **When** operator drags the scanned image into search area, **Then** system finds the original digital file and shows matching results
3. **Given** operator finds target photos, **When** they double-click a thumbnail, **Then** photo opens in default image viewer for immediate review
4. **Given** operator needs to access original file location, **When** they right-click a photo, **Then** system opens file explorer with the photo selected
5. **Given** studio has photos with people, **When** operator searches by enrolled person's face, **Then** system returns all photos containing that person

### Edge Cases
- What happens when search query returns no results? Display clear "no matches found" message with search suggestions.
- How does system handle corrupted or unreadable image files? Skip with warning in processing log, continue indexing other files.
- What if scanned photo quality is poor for reverse search? Allow manual cropping and show confidence scores for matches.
- How does system behave when storage drives are disconnected? Gracefully handle missing files, show offline status indicators.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

**Search Capabilities**
- **FR-001**: System MUST support text search across filenames, folder names, and extracted text content
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide date range filtering for photo search results
- **FR-003**: System MUST support reverse image search by accepting dropped or scanned photos as input
- **FR-004**: System MUST enable face-based search with opt-in enrollment of individuals
- **FR-005**: System MUST return search results within 2 seconds for text queries and 5 seconds for image-based queries

**Navigation and Access**
- **FR-006**: System MUST display search results as thumbnail grid with minimum 256px thumbnail size
- **FR-007**: Users MUST be able to open photos in default system viewer via double-click
- **FR-008**: Users MUST be able to reveal photo location in file explorer via right-click context menu
- **FR-009**: System MUST display photo metadata including filename, folder path, and capture date alongside thumbnails
- **FR-010**: System MUST show visual indicators for different match types (text match, face match, image similarity)

**Photo Processing and Indexing**
- **FR-011**: System MUST automatically index JPG, JPEG, PNG, and TIFF image formats
- **FR-012**: System MUST extract and index EXIF metadata from supported image files
- **FR-013**: System MUST perform optical character recognition on photos to enable text search
- **FR-014**: System MUST generate and cache thumbnail images for fast display
- **FR-015**: System MUST continuously monitor configured folders for new and changed files
- **FR-016**: System MUST handle library sizes up to 1 million photos on standard hardware
- **FR-017**: System MUST preserve original photo files without modification during indexing

**User Experience & Onboarding**
- **FR-018**: System MUST provide first-run onboarding wizard to guide folder selection and initial indexing
- **FR-019**: System MUST display full-screen photo lightbox with keyboard navigation (arrow keys, Esc)
- **FR-020**: System MUST support batch operations (export, delete, tag) on multiple selected photos
- **FR-021**: System MUST use virtual scrolling to maintain 60fps performance with 10K+ photos
- **FR-022**: System MUST show photo metadata overlay in lightbox (EXIF, tags, location)
- **FR-023**: System MUST provide visual selection mode with checkboxes for batch operations
- **FR-024**: System MUST move deleted photos to system trash (recoverable) instead of permanent deletion

**Desktop Experience**
- **FR-025**: System MUST provide code-signed installers for macOS, Windows, and Linux
- **FR-026**: System MUST include auto-update functionality with delta updates
- **FR-027**: System MUST download updates in background without blocking user interaction
- **FR-028**: System MUST allow users to disable auto-updates in settings

**Privacy and Security**
- **FR-029**: System MUST process all data locally without internet connectivity requirements
- **FR-030**: System MUST encrypt stored face recognition data when face search is enabled
- **FR-031**: System MUST require explicit user consent before enabling face recognition features
- **FR-032**: System MUST not send telemetry or analytics data to external servers

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Photo**: Represents individual image files with metadata including path, size, timestamps, format, and extracted content
- **Search Index**: Contains searchable text content extracted from filenames, folders, EXIF data, and OCR processing
- **Thumbnail**: Cached preview images generated from originals for fast grid display
- **Person**: Enrolled individual for face-based search with associated face recognition data
- **Search Result**: Matched photos with relevance scoring and match type indicators
